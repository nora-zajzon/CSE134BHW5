I refined my portfolio site by improving styling, optimizing JavaScript, and restructuring the repository for better maintainability. I separated CSS files per HTML page with a global stylesheet and organized files into dedicated folders. The forest theme now has a unified font for a more cohesive look, and margins were adjusted for consistency. I also fixed JSON path issues to properly render images and refactored the project card system for better code reuse. To enhance interactivity, I added a coursework toggle button that dynamically displays my completed classes, improving user engagement and accessibility. Additional UI refinements include removing redundant error messages, refining the empty state behavior for the load button, and replacing images for a more polished aesthetic. These changes make the portfolio more functional, readable, and visually consistent.
